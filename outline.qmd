# Introduction

* Motivation: why drawdowns matter more than volatility.
* Research questions and contributions.
* Roadmap of the document.

# Definitions and Measurement

## Core Drawdown Metrics

* Maximum Drawdown (MDD), Average Drawdown, Time Under Water (TUW), Ulcer Index.
* Recovery time (to prior peak), Triple Penance intuition.

## Return Process Assumptions

* i.i.d., AR(1), regime-switching, multifractal/heteroskedastic volatility.

## Reporting Standards

* Annualization conventions, sample frequency, estimation windows, confidence intervals.

# Literature Review (Condensed)

## Drawdown Theory

* Brownian/diffusion results, distributional properties, sensitivity to autocorrelation.

## Drawdown Risk Measures

* CED/CDaR and optimization under drawdown constraints.

## Predicting Drawdowns

* LPPL (Sornette), correlation/eigenvalue spikes, regime-switch probabilities, critical slowing down.
* Soros reflexivity (behavioral feedback); Mandelbrot multifractals (wild randomness).

## Stop-Loss Rules

* When they help/hurt; serial correlation, regime persistence, and transaction costs.

# Data and Infrastructure

## Assets and Horizons

* S\&P 500 total return (or SPY + dividends), US 7–10Y Treasuries (e.g., IEF), Bitcoin (BTC-USD).
* Daily frequency; extensions to intraday (optional).

## Sources

* CRSP/Compustat (if available), Yahoo/FRED/Quandl, Crypto exchange (Bitstamp/Coinbase).

## Cleaning and Alignment

* Corporate actions, holidays, time zone normalization, stable timestamp joins.

## Reproducibility

* Python env (requirements.txt), config.yml, deterministic seeds; data versioning notes.

# Simulation Framework

## Processes

* i.i.d. Gaussian; AR(1) with ρ ∈ \[−0.5, 0.5]; Markov Regime Switching (2–3 states).
* Optional: GARCH(1,1) / stochastic volatility for clustered vol.

## Metrics

* CAGR, Vol, Sharpe, MDD, AvgDD, TUW, recovery time; CI via MC SE.

## Experiments

* Vary ρ at μ=0; vary μ at ρ=0; grid over (μ, ρ, σ).
* Add costs and slippage stress (spread regimes, gap risk).

## Outputs

* Lines + shaded 95% CIs for each metric; heatmaps (μ×ρ) for MDD/Sharpe; frontier plots (AvgDD vs Sharpe vs CAGR).

# Empirical Measurement

## Estimation

* Rolling μ, σ, ρ; realized vol; rolling MDD/AvgDD/TUW; recovery time post drawdown.

## Case Studies

* Dot-com, GFC, COVID crash; BTC 2017 & 2021 cycles.

## Cross-Asset Views

* Equity vs Rates vs BTC: compare level and *shape* of drawdown paths.

# Early-Warning Signals

## Price-Dynamics

* LPPL fits with stability checks; parameter constraints; out-of-sample tracking.

## Correlation/Systemic Risk

* Rolling correlation matrices; top eigenvalue; PCA concentration; breadth.

## Volatility/Resilience

* Realized & implied vol, term structures; critical slowing down (AC(1), variance rise).

## Liquidity/Microstructure (optional if data available)

* Amihud illiquidity, bid–ask spreads, order-book depth proxies; ETF prem/discount.

## Cross-Asset “Risk Compass”

* Credit spreads (IG/HY), VIX term slope, MOVE, gold vs USD, stablecoins (for BTC stress).

## Evaluation

* Hazard/survival models for “entering a ≥X% drawdown within Y days.”
* Calibration curves, AUC/PR, Brier score; utility-based scoring (downside heat avoided).

# Stop-Loss and Dynamic De-Risking

## Rules Tested

* Fixed % trailing stops; vol-scaled stops; time-based re-entries; breakout/breakdown overlays.

## Cost Model

* Commissions, slippage, spread widening in stress; execution style variants (MKT/LMT/VWAP).

## Strategy Context

* Apply overlays to Buy-and-Hold, Time-Series Momentum, Mean-Reversion, Carry.

## Results

* Net of costs: MDD/AvgDD reduction vs CAGR drag; Sharpe and TUW changes.
* Sensitivity to ρ, regime persistence, and signal noise.

# Alternatives and Complements to Stop-Loss

## Tail Hedges

* Long vol (VIX futures/options), protective puts, collars; budgeted hedge overlays.

## Dynamic Allocation

* Risk parity tilt down in correlation spikes; target-vol controls; drawdown-triggered de-risk.

## Benchmarking

* Compare stop-loss vs hedges on same capital budget and turnover.

# Model Integration and Policy

## Decision Engine

* “Traffic light” risk state combining signals (Bayesian or logistic ensemble).
* Action map: exposure cuts, stop threshold tightening, or hedge activation.

## Governance

* Parameter stability, look-ahead and multiple-testing controls, live-vs-paper tracking.

# Robustness and Pitfalls

* Multiple hypothesis risk, data-snooping, regime instability.
* Backtest overfitting (walk-forward, nested CV, expanding windows).
* Stress scenarios: liquidity drought, price gaps, stale quotes, trading halts.

# Results Synthesis

* What simulations predict vs what we observe.
* When stop-losses help (trend, persistent bad regimes, cheap trading) vs hurt (noise, mean-reversion, high costs).
* Practical guidance: default settings, “turn off” conditions, and monitoring cadence.

# Conclusions and Practitioner Checklist

* Plain-English takeaways for risk committees.
* Implementation checklist (data, dashboards, controls).

## B. Data Tables and Parameter Grids

## Suggested Figures (at minimum)

* Simulation lines w/ shaded CIs (CAGR/Vol/MDD/Sharpe vs ρ and vs μ).
* Empirical drawdown panels for each asset (wealth + drawdown).
* Early-warning dashboard (eigenvalue, vol, breadth, LPPL risk window).
* Stop-loss vs buy-and-hold scatter/frontier (AvgDD vs Sharpe).
* Comparison of stop-loss vs tail-hedge effectiveness.

## Datasets and Proxies (pragmatic defaults)

* **S\&P 500 TR**: ^SP500TR or SPY + dividend adjustment.
* **US 7–10Y**: IEF (or constant-maturity 10Y TR approximation).
* **Bitcoin**: BTC-USD (daily close; consider multiple exchanges for robustness).
* **Signals**: VIX, MOVE, HY OAS (FRED), ADV/DECL breadth, PCA on sector returns.

## Methods Notes (to avoid common traps)

* Use **expanding windows** for parameter estimation in tests to avoid look-ahead.
* Lock signal generation cutoff (e.g., NY close + 5m) and trade next bar open/close consistently.
* Apply **transaction cost stress** (base, ×2, ×3 spreads) and **execution variants**.
* Report **CIs** for all key metrics; highlight **TUW** and **recovery time** alongside MDD.

## Implementation Roadmap (actionable)

1. **Finalize metrics + thresholds** (e.g., MDD trigger sizes, LPPL window lengths, eigenvalue window).
2. **Build the dashboard**: rolling μ/σ/ρ, MDD/TUW, eigenvalue(1), vol term structures, breadth.
3. **Run baselines**: simulations (μ/ρ grids with CIs), empirical metrics for each asset.
4. **Fit early-warning models**: hazard model with k-fold time splits; calibrate probabilities.
5. **Overlay tests**: stop-loss variants and tail-hedge benchmarks with cost scenarios.
6. **Case-study narratives**: align dashboard states to known events; sanity-check timing.
7. **Synthesize**: frontier plots, policy rules, and a one-pager of recommendations.
