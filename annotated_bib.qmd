* **Authors**: Adam Rej, Philip Seager, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud
* **Abstract summary**: Provides closed-form probability distributions for the *length* and *depth* of the *last drawdown* in upward-drifting Brownian motion, offering quantitative criteria to spot when a drawdown is “too long” or “too deep” relative to the assumed Sharpe ratio. ([arxiv.org][1])

### Theory of drawdowns & their distributions

- **Magdon-Ismail, Atiya, Pratap, Abu-Mostafa (2004)**  
  Closed-form and series-based results for the maximum drawdown of Brownian motion with drift—fundamental baseline for theoretical modelling.

- **Hadjiliadis & Vecer**  
  First-passage and drawdown properties for diffusion processes; frames drawdowns in terms of “time to crash.”

- **Rej, Seager & Bouchaud (2017)** — *“You Are in a Drawdown…, When Should You Start Worrying?”*  
  Derives exact distributions for the length and depth of the most recent drawdown in upward-drifting Brownian motion, offering quantitative alert thresholds where drawdowns exceed what the assumed Sharpe ratio predicts.

* **Rej, Seager & Bouchaud (2017)** — Provides thresholds for when current drawdowns are statistically unusual, given a strategy’s historical Sharpe ratio (see above).
