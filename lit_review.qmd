# Literature Review

The study of drawdowns—measured as the peak-to-trough declines in portfolio value—has attracted sustained attention in both theoretical and applied finance. Unlike volatility, which is a symmetric measure of dispersion, drawdown captures the path-dependent nature of losses and is directly interpretable by practitioners as the magnitude of loss from the most recent peak. Foundational work by @MagdonIsmail2004_mdd_brownian develops closed-form and series approximations for the distribution of maximum drawdown in Brownian motion with drift. This framework provides baseline expectations for MDD under simple return processes, making it a starting point for both simulation studies and empirical benchmarking.

Extensions of this line of research incorporate more general stochastic processes. @HadjiliadisVecer_drawdown_diffusions explore drawdowns in diffusion models using first-passage-time techniques, highlighting how the statistical properties of the underlying process, such as volatility or drift, affect the likelihood and timing of large drawdowns. These results bridge the gap between idealized Brownian settings and more realistic models where volatility is time-varying or returns are serially correlated.

Recent work by @Rej2017_drawdown_warning addresses a question of practical relevance: given an ongoing drawdown, when should an investor start to worry? Using an upward-drifting Brownian motion model, they derive exact probability distributions for the depth and length of the *current* drawdown. Their results yield quantitative thresholds based on an assumed Sharpe ratio, allowing practitioners to identify when the current drawdown is statistically unusual. This approach directly informs real-time monitoring and decision-making.

While MDD is the most widely recognized path-dependent risk measure, alternative metrics focus on average drawdowns or conditional measures. @GoldbergMahmoud2014_ced introduce Conditional Expected Drawdown (CED), defined as the average of the worst α-fraction of drawdowns over a given horizon. They show that CED is sensitive to serial correlation, making it a useful diagnostic for strategies where returns are not i.i.d. Similarly, the Conditional Drawdown-at-Risk (CDaR) framework of @Chekhlov2005_cdar generalizes Value-at-Risk concepts to path-dependent losses, enabling portfolio optimization under drawdown-based constraints.

An important branch of the literature examines optimal portfolio choice under explicit drawdown constraints. The seminal work of @GrossmanZhou1993_drawdown_constraints develops a continuous-time optimal investment strategy that maximizes expected utility subject to a cap on allowable drawdown. Building on this, @Angoshtari2015_drawdown_probability investigate strategies that minimize the probability of drawdown in a Black–Scholes setting with payout structures, offering tractable solutions for investors concerned with the likelihood rather than the magnitude of drawdowns. In a related vein, @HsiehBarmish2017_drawdown_feedback propose drawdown-modulated feedback control, linking portfolio allocation rules to observed drawdown levels, and showing how this approach relates to Kelly criterion optimization.

Predicting drawdowns before they reach their peak remains challenging. @HarveyLiu2020_drawdown_greeks introduce “drawdown Greeks,” quantifying the sensitivity of drawdown statistics to parameters such as Sharpe ratio, investment horizon, and autocorrelation. They demonstrate that even modest positive autocorrelation can substantially increase drawdown risk. Complementary work by @Bailey2014_triple_penance formulates the “Triple Penance Rule,” which states that recovery time from a drawdown can be roughly three times the time taken to reach the maximum loss in the presence of positive serial correlation. This has significant implications for performance evaluation and capital allocation.

Market structure indicators can also provide early warning signals. @Conlon2010_drawdown_correlation show that periods with large eigenvalues in the correlation matrix of asset returns tend to coincide with major market drawdowns. This finding suggests that shifts toward high market co-movement may precede large losses, offering a potential avenue for predictive modeling beyond univariate return statistics.

Another strand of research assesses whether stop-loss rules, which mechanically reduce exposure after losses, can mitigate drawdowns. @KaminskiLo2014_stoploss develop a formal framework showing that, under a random walk model, stop-loss rules generally reduce expected returns without improving risk-adjusted performance. However, in the presence of momentum or regime-switching behavior, these rules can add value by cutting losses during adverse regimes. Similarly, @Zambelli2016_bayesian_stoploss proposes a Bayesian approach to calibrating stop thresholds based on observed maximum drawdown distributions, demonstrating potential improvements in intraday trading strategies.

Collectively, this literature establishes a rich set of tools for understanding, measuring, predicting, and mitigating drawdowns. Theoretical models provide closed-form benchmarks for MDD under simple stochastic processes, while extensions incorporate path-dependent risk measures such as CED and CDaR. Optimization approaches integrate drawdown constraints directly into portfolio choice, and empirical studies highlight the role of serial correlation, market co-movement, and regime shifts in exacerbating drawdowns. Stop-loss rules remain context-dependent: their value depends critically on the return dynamics of the underlying strategy.

The current study builds on this body of work by combining simulation analysis under controlled return processes with empirical measurement using the S&P 500, US 10-Year Treasury Notes, and Bitcoin. This dual approach allows us to test theoretical predictions in real markets, explore the effect of autocorrelation on MDD, and evaluate the performance of stop-loss overlays across distinct asset classes and market regimes.
