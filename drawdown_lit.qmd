# Drawdowns as a Tail Risk Measure: Literature Review

## Introduction

In finance, a **drawdown** is the peak-to-trough decline in the value of an investment over a specified period. It measures the cumulative loss from the most recent high point (peak) to the subsequent low point (trough) before a new peak is attained. As such, drawdowns capture the experience of an investor who rides a strategy up to a peak and then suffers losses. Because large drawdowns often coincide with rare, extreme market moves, they are regarded as a **tail risk** measure – focusing on worst-case loss scenarios rather than typical day-to-day volatility. Drawdowns have long been used by practitioners (especially in hedge funds and trading advisors) as a key risk indicator. Academic literature on drawdowns has expanded in recent decades, examining both theoretical properties and empirical behavior of drawdown-based risk metrics across various asset classes.

Early work recognized two primary advantages of using drawdowns to quantify risk. **Johansen and Sornette (2002)** emphasized that (i) drawdowns represent the total loss an investor experiences since their latest peak wealth, and (ii) drawdowns capture the *interplay of a series of losses*, reflecting how consecutive declines can amplify overall loss. In other words, drawdowns naturally incorporate path-dependency: a *sequence* of moderate losses can lead to a large drawdown, an effect missed by single-period risk measures. This path-dependent nature distinguishes drawdown risk from conventional risk measures like volatility or Value-at-Risk (VaR), which typically consider the distribution of returns over a fixed horizon without regard to the time order of gains and losses. As a result, drawdown-based metrics can highlight risks that conventional moment-based measures might overlook. For example, an investment strategy might exhibit steady returns (low volatility) yet be susceptible to an occasional severe crash; the maximum drawdown would flag this tail risk, whereas the volatility or VaR might not fully capture it.

This review summarizes the academic literature on drawdowns as a tail risk measure. We cover theoretical developments (including formal risk measure definitions and portfolio optimization approaches) and empirical findings (spanning multiple asset classes and market conditions). We compare drawdown-based measures to standard risk metrics such as VaR, Conditional VaR (Expected Shortfall), and volatility, highlighting their relative advantages, limitations, and use cases. Primary references to influential papers and recent research are provided throughout.

## Drawdown-Based Risk Measures: Definitions and Extensions

**Maximum Drawdown (MDD)** – the most common drawdown metric – is defined as the single largest peak-to-trough decline observed over a time period. Formally, if \$M\_t\$ is the running maximum of the portfolio value up to time \$t\$, then the drawdown at time \$t\$ is \$D\_t = (M\_t - P\_t)/M\_t\$, and the *maximum drawdown* over horizon $\[0,T]\$ is the supremum of \$D\_t\$ for \$t\in\[0,T]\$. In practice, MDD is often expressed as a percentage drop from the peak. It is a **path-dependent** statistic: even if final returns are positive, MDD captures interim downturns. MDD is widely reported in performance reports of hedge funds and commodity trading advisors, and it gained further prominence after events like the 2008 crisis where many portfolios saw drawdowns exceeding 50%.

Researchers have proposed several extensions to better characterize drawdown risk beyond a single worst-case observation:

* **Average Drawdown (AvDD)**: This metric computes the average magnitude of drawdowns over a period. It smooths out the risk measure by considering all drawdowns, not just the worst. AvDD is sometimes used to gauge the typical severity of losses an investor endures, complementing the maximum drawdown.

* **Conditional Drawdown (CDD)**: Introduced by *Chekhlov, Uryasev, and Zabarankin (2005)*, CDD (also called **Conditional Drawdown at Risk, CDaR**) refers to the average of the worst \$q%\$ drawdowns in the sample path. For example, the CDD at 95% might average the most severe 5% of drawdowns during the period. This provides a risk measure that is less extreme than MDD (since it’s an average of tail losses rather than the single maximum) but still focuses on the tail of the drawdown distribution. One key advantage of CDD is that it “takes into account several significant drawdown periods” simultaneously, rather than ignoring the second-worst, third-worst losses, etc.. CDD has been used in portfolio optimization to impose drawdown risk constraints, as in Chekhlov et al. (2005), who showed how controlling CDD can aid asset-allocation decisions.

* **Conditional Expected Drawdown (CED)**: More recently, *Goldberg and Mahmoud (2017)* formalized **CED** as the *tail mean of the distribution of maximum drawdowns*. Instead of looking at one historical path, this approach considers a probabilistic view: imagine many hypothetical scenarios or simulations of a portfolio’s returns, each with its own maximum drawdown. CED is the expected value of the worst \$\alpha\$% of those simulated max drawdowns (analogous to how expected shortfall is the average of the worst losses beyond VaR). In other words, CED (sometimes termed **Conditional MDaR** or **Max Drawdown at Risk**) is a *second-order* tail risk measure: it first looks at extreme drawdowns in each scenario, then averages across scenarios’ tails. Conceptually, CED is similar to Conditional VaR/Expected Shortfall, but applied to drawdowns rather than period returns. Goldberg and Mahmoud show that due to path-dependency, CED is **more sensitive to serial correlations** in returns than conventional expected shortfall or volatility measures. Intuitively, if returns have trends or momentum (causing consecutive losses), drawdowns will deepen, and CED will reflect this risk more strongly than distributional tail measures that assume i.i.d. returns. (Notably, Goldberg and Mahmoud also find that CED is *not* a fully coherent risk measure in the sense of Artzner et al. (1999), but it is a convex risk measure, meaning it can still be utilized in optimization frameworks.)

* **Maximum Drawdown at Risk (MDaR)**: This term typically refers to a high-quantile of the **distribution of maximum drawdowns**. For example, the 95% MDaR might be the level \$d\$ such that there is only a 5% probability that the portfolio’s drawdown over the horizon exceeds \$d\$. This is akin to a VaR of drawdown magnitude. *Mendes and Mendes (2017)* (Finance Research Letters) argue that MDaR is an important tool for hedge funds, CTAs, and even regulators, especially for longer horizon risk assessment (since drawdowns usually unfold over multiple days or weeks, unlike the typical 1-day VaR). Their study develops Monte Carlo simulation methods to estimate MDaR and finds that the distribution of maximum drawdowns has a heavy right tail (a stylized fact), requiring extreme-value techniques for accurate estimation.

* **Drawdown-Based Performance Ratios**: In practice, several performance metrics incorporate drawdown to penalize downside risk. For instance, the **Calmar ratio** (Young, 1991) is defined as annualized return divided by maximum drawdown, widely used to evaluate hedge fund performance over a 3-year period. The **Sterling ratio** and **Pain index** similarly use average drawdowns in the denominator. The **Martin ratio** (or **Ulcer Index** by Martin and McCann, 1989) goes further by considering both drawdown depth *and duration*, essentially using the root-mean-square of drawdowns to penalize long, sustained losses. Martin and McCann argued that investors are more concerned with “how much their portfolio can drop” during an investment than with volatility. By squaring drawdowns, the Ulcer Index disproportionately penalizes **large, long-lasting retracements**, addressing investors’ pain during protracted downturns. These metrics underscore the practical importance of drawdowns: an investment with mild, short-lived dips is considered far less risky (and more attractive) than one with the same volatility but deeper or prolonged drawdowns.

* **Other Variants**: *Zabarankin et al. (2014)* proposed a “**β–Conditional Drawdown**” measure to identify assets that hedge against market drawdowns. A \$\beta\_{\text{MDD}}\$ of –1 means an asset tends to *gain* as much as the market’s loss during major drawdowns, i.e. a perfect hedge in downturns. Another variant is the **End-of-Period Drawdown (eopDD)** introduced by Möller (2018), which measures how far the final portfolio value at the horizon lies below the peak value achieved during the period. This is relevant for investors who care about terminal wealth relative to the high-water mark (e.g. to assess regret at not locking in the peak gains). While less studied, these variants illustrate the flexibility of drawdown concepts to target specific risk concerns (hedging market crashes, or end-period regret).

In summary, the literature has developed a rich family of drawdown-based risk measures. They range from simple historical metrics (MDD) to more complex statistical measures (CDD, CED, MDaR) that integrate drawdowns into coherent risk management frameworks. All share a common focus on capturing the **extremes** of loss in a path-dependent way, setting them apart from traditional risk measures.

## Comparison to Standard Risk Metrics (VaR, CVaR, Volatility, ES)

A central theme in the literature is how drawdown measures compare with more standard tail risk metrics like Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall, as well as to volatility (standard deviation). Drawdowns are fundamentally different because they consider the *trajectory* of losses, not just the distribution of outcomes at a fixed horizon. Below we highlight key comparisons:

* **Value-at-Risk (VaR)**: VaR at level \$\alpha\$ is the cutoff loss such that \$\alpha\$% of the time the loss will not exceed that amount over a set horizon. It is typically computed for short horizons (1-day or 10-day) under distributional assumptions. VaR does *not* capture how losses might accumulate over time beyond that horizon. A portfolio might have a modest daily VaR but could still experience a large gradual drawdown over months. Drawdown measures fill this gap by monitoring cumulative loss from peaks *regardless of when it occurs*. In essence, **VaR is an endpoint-oriented metric, whereas drawdown is path-oriented**. As Goldstein and Taleb (2007) note, VaR is often extrapolated from volatility under assumptions that may not hold in crises, and it can give a false sense of security. Volatility-based VaR is not very intuitive for investors (who think in dollar or percentage losses), and it is known to be unstable during regime changes. By contrast, *maximum drawdown is intuitive*: it directly answers “how bad could it get?” in terms of portfolio decline. A drawdown-based VaR (i.e. MDaR) can be seen as the multi-period extension of VaR, capturing the risk of a worst-case cumulative loss over longer horizons.

* **Expected Shortfall (ES/CVaR)**: Expected Shortfall (also called CVaR) is the average loss in the worst \$q%\$ of outcomes. It improves upon VaR by being sensitive to the tail’s severity. However, like VaR, ES is usually defined for a single-period loss distribution (e.g. one-day or one-month return). It *does not consider the temporal order* of losses within that period. A 20% loss in one day vs. four 5% losses over four days might both yield a similar one-month loss, hence similar ES for that month – but the latter scenario involves a deeper interim drawdown (the portfolio lost 5%, then 10%, 15%, etc., hitting a 20% drawdown mid-way). Drawdown measures would register the intermediate pain, while ES only sees the final outcome. Researchers have drawn direct analogies between ES and drawdown-based measures: for example, CDD and CED were explicitly constructed to mirror the *quantile and tail-mean* approach of VaR/ES, but applied to the distribution of drawdowns. Like ES, these drawdown metrics can be made coherent or convex. Indeed, Conditional Drawdown (CDaR) as defined by Chekhlov et al. (2005) is a coherent risk measure under certain conditions, and Conditional Expected Drawdown (CED) is convex (though not fully coherent). In practice, one might use ES and CED side by side: ES to quantify *instantaneous* tail risk and CED to quantify *cumulative path* tail risk. Goldberg and Mahmoud (2017) found that **CED reacts more to serially correlated tail events** than ES. This means in markets where downturns persist over consecutive periods (a common feature in crises), drawdown-based tail measures may flag risk earlier or more sharply than ES, which assumes each period’s loss is an independent draw.

* **Volatility (Standard Deviation)**: Volatility is a symmetric risk measure that captures typical variation, not specifically downside extremes. A portfolio with frequent small swings can have high volatility but might never suffer a major drawdown if losses are quickly recovered. Conversely, a portfolio with low daily volatility could still accumulate a large drawdown if it has a slow, steady decline. **Drawdown directly addresses downside deviation from a peak**, which volatility does not distinguish. As Martin and McCann (1989) observed, investors care more about the *depth of decline* than the oscillations along the way. Moreover, volatility is a second-moment measure that assumes returns cluster around an average; it does not capture skewness or tail fatness well. Drawdowns, by focusing on extremes, implicitly account for fat tails – a string of losses leading to a deep drawdown is an expression of non-normal risk. In fact, empirical studies show that maximum drawdowns have distributions with heavy tails (long right tail), reflecting the possibility of very large cumulative losses. Volatility alone cannot indicate the risk of ruin or the time to recovery from losses, whereas drawdown metrics explicitly highlight those. However, it’s worth noting that in stable periods, volatility and drawdown can be correlated: if returns are roughly symmetric and iid, a higher volatility will, on average, produce larger drawdowns as well. But in *nonlinear, trending, or regime-switching environments*, the divergence is stark – drawdown becomes a much more relevant gauge of risk. For instance, Lee (2016) points out that tail events (which manifest as sudden or deep drawdowns) can wipe out years of returns, even if preceding volatility was low. This underscores that controlling only volatility (as many traditional portfolios do) is not sufficient to manage tail risk.

In summary, drawdown-based measures complement standard risk metrics by addressing *what those metrics might miss*: the timing and accumulation of losses. VaR and ES are useful for short-term risk control and regulatory capital, while drawdown measures speak to an investor’s experience over time and the risk of hitting painful loss thresholds. A number of authors (e.g. Schuhmacher and Eling 2011) have argued that both traditional and drawdown-based metrics can be consistent under certain utility assumptions, but drawdown measures explicitly focus on worst-case outcomes important to loss-averse investors.

## Theoretical Perspectives and Portfolio Optimization with Drawdowns

From a theoretical standpoint, drawdowns pose interesting challenges because of their path-dependent nature. A rich body of literature has grown around formulating drawdown risk in rigorous ways and incorporating it into portfolio choice models:

* **Coherence and Convexity**: Traditional risk measure theory (Artzner et al., 1999) introduced criteria for “coherent” risk measures (monotonicity, subadditivity, translation invariance, homogeneity). Standard deviation is not coherent (due to lack of focus on tail), VaR is not subadditive in general, but ES is coherent. Where do drawdown measures stand? The **maximum drawdown** itself, as a single-path historical statistic, is not directly a subadditive measure (combining portfolios can actually reduce worst drawdown, which is a desirable diversification effect, but it means MDD of a combined portfolio is not a straightforward sum or weighted average of individual MDDs). To integrate drawdown into risk management, researchers like Chekhlov et al. (2005) sought coherent or convex formulations. They showed that **Conditional Drawdown (CDaR)** – essentially the average of worst-case drawdowns at a chosen confidence level – can be treated as a coherent risk measure in portfolio optimization. Later, Goldberg and Mahmoud (2014) demonstrated that CED (tail mean of max drawdowns) is not coherent but is a **convex** risk measure, which still guarantees that optimization problems remain tractable (convex optimization). The upshot is that modern drawdown measures can satisfy the formal properties needed for sound risk management, allowing integration into optimization and risk constraint frameworks similar to how one uses CVaR. This theoretical development has been important in legitimizing drawdowns in academic risk modeling, beyond their intuitive appeal.

* **Optimal Portfolio under Drawdown Constraints**: A strand of research in mathematical finance looks at strategies that explicitly limit drawdown. *Grossman and Zhou (1993)* is a seminal paper deriving the optimal investment strategy when an investor wants to maximize growth but never let the portfolio drop below a fraction of its historical peak (a drawdown constraint). This leads to option-like protection strategies or stopping rules (e.g. dynamically shifting into safe assets after certain losses). *Cvitanic and Karatzas (1999)* studied drawdowns in a similar vein, treating the drawdown level as a state variable in optimal control. These works, though theoretical, underscore that **protecting against drawdowns often entails nonlinear, path-dependent strategies** (like buying put options or using stop-loss rules) rather than static mean-variance allocations. More recent work by Zabarankin et al. (2014) and others has extended portfolio theory to include drawdown-based objectives or constraints. For example, one can construct portfolios that minimize the CED or satisfy a maximum drawdown at risk limit (e.g. “the 95% worst drawdown should be no more than 20%”). *Hoesli and Hamelink (2004)* showed that optimizing a portfolio on a **return-to-drawdown** basis yields significantly *lower drawdowns* than a traditional mean-variance optimal portfolio, albeit with some trade-off in return. This indicates that explicitly accounting for drawdown risk can lead to different, often more diversified portfolios (favoring assets that don’t all crash together) compared to classic Markowitz optimization. Relatedly, *Kim (2011)* established links between Markowitz’s mean-variance criterion and drawdown, explaining how fund selection can change when MDD is considered alongside or instead of variance.

* **Analytical Properties and Pricing**: Some researchers have delved into the statistical properties of drawdowns and even pricing of drawdown-related derivatives. *Pospíšil and Večer (2007, 2010)* derived results for the distribution of maximum drawdown under certain stochastic processes and introduced sensitivities (Greeks) of financial contracts to drawdown risk. Večer (2007) famously provided a way to price an option that pays based on the maximum drawdown of an asset – effectively treating drawdown as an observable contingent claim. These studies highlight that drawdowns can be incorporated into the toolkit of quantitative finance: one can compute expected drawdowns, likelihood of exceeding a given drawdown (hitting probability), and even hedge against drawdowns using derivatives. However, such models often require more complex mathematics (e.g. solving partial differential equations or using Monte Carlo simulations), reflecting the complexity of the drawdown stochastic process (which involves running maxima). The **duration of drawdowns** has also been studied – e.g. how long an asset stays below its peak. Analytical results for drawdown duration distributions have been obtained for Brownian motion and other processes (e.g. **Martin and Kearney (2018)** study the “time since maximum” as a related statistic). These theoretical insights, while advanced, reinforce the view of drawdown as a distinct dimension of risk – encompassing both depth and duration of losses.

In summary, theoretical research treats drawdown both as a *constraint* to respect (to avoid ruin or unacceptable losses) and as a *risk measure* to minimize. The consensus is that because drawdowns capture extreme risk in a way investors viscerally care about, including them in portfolio design leads to strategies that are more robust to tail events, albeit sometimes at the cost of lower nominal returns due to insurance-like protections.

## Empirical Studies Across Asset Classes

Empirical literature has examined drawdowns in equity markets, hedge funds, commodities, and beyond, often to illustrate where traditional risk measures fall short:

* **Historical Market Crises**: It is well documented that major market events (Great Depression, Dot-com bust, 2008 Global Financial Crisis, COVID-19 crash) involve protracted drawdowns. For instance, during 2008–2009 many global equity indices and funds suffered drawdowns exceeding 50%, taking years to recover. Such events underscore tail risk: even assets with benign long-run averages can experience sudden regime shifts. Drawdown analysis of long-term data often finds **power-law distributions** of drawdown sizes for markets (a few very large crashes, many small dips) – a signature of heavy tails and volatility clustering. Johansen and Sornette, in their study of drawdowns, linked large drawdowns to factors like herding and feedback trading that create self-reinforcing sell-offs. They noted that the largest drawdowns often correspond to periods of **correlated losses** (e.g. panics), whereas mild drawdowns happen in more idiosyncratic times. Thus, empirical drawdown distributions provide insight into market dynamics beyond what a return distribution shows.

* **Hedge Funds and Managed Funds**: Because hedge funds often employ leverage and active strategies, investors and due diligence analysts pay close attention to their maximum drawdowns. *Eling and Schuhmacher (2007)* compared 12 different risk-adjusted performance measures (many drawdown-based, like Calmar and Sterling) on a large sample of hedge funds. Interestingly, despite the non-normal returns of hedge funds, they found that the ranking of funds by Sharpe ratio was **highly correlated** with rankings by drawdown-based measures. In other words, a fund with a higher Sharpe often also had a better (smaller) drawdown, suggesting that in broad samples, many risk measures agree on ordering. However, they and subsequent studies caution that **in volatile or skewed markets, differences emerge**. For example, *Kessler et al. (2019)*, looking at value-investing strategies, found that variation in maximum drawdowns across strategies could not be explained by Sharpe ratios alone – some strategies with similar Sharpe had very different tail risk profiles. Moreover, *Schuhmacher and Eling (2011)* used simulations to show that under certain investor utility functions, performance measures that penalize drawdowns can be justified, aligning with investors’ risk aversion to large losses.

* **Anomalies and Tail Risk**: A particularly illuminating empirical use of drawdowns is in evaluating asset pricing anomalies or strategies. *Gray and Vogel (2013)* and *Gebauer et al.* (as referenced in an NAAIM paper by Gray) proposed using maximum drawdown to gauge the tail risk of so-called “market neutral” anomaly strategies. Many academic strategies (like momentum, carry, etc.) boast high Sharpe ratios, but when implemented, they occasionally experience dramatic crashes (e.g. momentum crashes). By examining historical **max drawdowns** of these strategies, researchers found that *“anomalies are not so anomalous”* – virtually all such strategies suffer large drawdowns at some point. These losses can be severe enough to trigger margin calls or investor redemptions, effectively rendering the strategy unviable despite good average returns. Thus, drawdown analysis revealed the latent tail risk unnoticed by linear factor models or by volatility. This has important implications: it suggests that high average returns of anomalies may be compensation for occasional huge losses (a classic risk premium story), something that would be missed if one looked only at variance or VaR of monthly returns.

* **Diversification and Portfolio Context**: Empirical studies also explore how drawdown-based risk interacts with diversification. *Adam et al. (2008)* noted that using drawdown-focused measures tends to produce more **diversified portfolios** – because to avoid large losses, one must avoid concentrated bets that can all crash together. Conversely, an approach that solely minimizes maximum drawdown might end up selecting only very low-volatility assets (those with “smaller tails”), which could sacrifice the benefits of diversification in pursuit of stability. This reflects a trade-off seen empirically: portfolios engineered to minimize drawdown (like certain risk-parity or trend-following strategies) often include a variety of uncorrelated assets (to ensure no single downturn wrecks the portfolio), whereas portfolios targeting only variance reduction might still be exposed to common shocks. Empirical analyses in commodity portfolios (Auer and Schuhmacher 2013; Auer 2015) and real estate investment trusts (Stein et al. 2013) have applied drawdown measures to understand performance in those asset classes. For example, REITs have distinct drawdown patterns due to property cycles, which standard deviation might understate; a drawdown perspective revealed periods where REIT investors were underwater for extended durations (a risk to liquidity and investor patience).

* **New Risk Measures and Recent Data**: Recent research has even proposed *alternative definitions* of drawdown-based performance. *Challet (2017)* introduced the concept of ranking assets by **total time spent in drawdown** (cumulative duration below previous peaks) rather than just depth. When applied to asset returns, this gave significantly different rankings than traditional volatility or Sharpe-based rankings, especially during turbulent periods. The intuition is that some assets might recover quickly from losses (short drawdowns) while others languish for long periods; investors might prefer the former even if both had similar volatilities. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 provided fresh data on rapid drawdowns and recoveries. The swift 30% drop and rebound in equities tested risk measures’ responsiveness. It highlighted that while one-month VaR or ES spiked and then normalized, a maximum drawdown measure captured the full depth of the plunge and showed a more persistent impact until the recovery was complete. This event re-invigorated interest in drawdown risk management, as noted by recent survey papers. Regulators and risk managers post-2020 are increasingly aware that *liquidity and behavioral effects* in such quick drawdowns matter – investors who panic-sell during a drawdown turn a paper loss into a realized loss. Strategies that explicitly manage drawdown (via stop-loss rules or protective assets) were shown to outperform on a risk-adjusted basis during these extremes, lending empirical support to the theoretical emphasis on drawdown control.

In summary, across equities, hedge funds, commodities, and other assets, drawdown-based analysis has revealed facets of risk not visible to standard deviation or single-period tail measures. In calm times, drawdown and volatility may tell similar stories, but in **stress times, drawdowns provide a clearer picture of tail vulnerability and recovery**. The empirical literature supports the idea that drawdown is a **universal concern** – relevant in any asset class – because human investors ultimately experience risk as the journey of losses and gains, not just a distribution of final outcomes.

## Advantages of Drawdown as a Risk Metric

Drawdown-based risk measures offer several distinct advantages, highlighted repeatedly in the literature:

* **Captures Path-Dependent Risk:** Drawdowns reflect the sequence and accumulation of losses, making them sensitive to phenomena like **serial correlation** or trending markets. This means they can detect dangers (like a slow bleeding loss) that VaR or volatility, which assume independent or symmetric fluctuations, might underestimate. As Johansen & Sornette noted, drawdowns show the *amplification mechanism* of consecutive losses leading to further selling (feedback loops), which is crucial in crises.

* **Focus on Worst-Case Scenarios:** Drawdown measures squarely address investors’ primary concern: “How bad can it get?” They emphasize *tail outcomes* (worst single loss or worst average losses) rather than average risk. Schuhmacher & Eling (2011) stress that this focus on worst-case aligns with scenarios that standard metrics (Sharpe ratio, etc.) do not directly consider. This makes drawdown metrics particularly useful for *risk management and capital preservation* goals.

* **Intuitive and Communicative:** Unlike statistical measures (variance, VaR at 99% in dollars, etc.), a drawdown is easy to understand for investors. “A 20% drawdown” plainly means the portfolio dropped 20% from a peak at worst. This clarity is valuable for client communications and setting expectations. Indeed, practitioners favor maximum drawdown as a headline risk metric because it resonates – *it’s what clients remember* (e.g. “My portfolio was down 30% at one point last year”). Researchers have noted that this intuitive appeal is a strength: maximum drawdown is “simple to calculate” and directly ties to the investor’s experience of pain.

* **Psychologically Relevant:** Drawdowns align with behavioral finance insights. Under **Prospect Theory** (Tversky & Kahneman, 1979), losses hurt more than gains please, and recent peaks serve as reference points. Being below one’s peak (in a drawdown) can trigger regret, fear, and risk-aversion. Drawdown measures implicitly incorporate these behavioral reference points. As noted by Frydman & Camerer (2016), including behavioral aspects leads to better financial decision-making. Thus, managing drawdowns can be seen as managing investor psychology – limiting drawdown magnitude and duration can prevent panic selling and loss of confidence.

* **Applicability Across Strategies and Assets:** Drawdown is a *universal concept* – it can be applied to any time series of returns, making it comparable across asset classes and investment strategies. Whether it’s an equity fund, a bond portfolio, a commodity strategy or even a crypto asset, the notion of “what is the worst peak-to-valley loss we’ve seen (or could expect)” is always meaningful. This generality means drawdown-based statistics can provide a common risk language when comparing disparate investments (which volatility or VaR might not, since return distributions differ). It’s one reason regulators and allocators sometimes look at maximum drawdowns of funds alongside other metrics.

* **Complements Other Risk Measures:** Drawdowns don’t necessarily replace VaR/ES or volatility; they complement them. Because drawdown risk often cannot be inferred from volatility alone, using a drawdown metric in tandem with traditional measures gives a more complete risk profile. For example, a fund could boast a low volatility but also have a history of occasional deep drawdowns – a combination that would be immediately flagged if one looks at both metrics together. Multiple studies (e.g. Kessler et al. 2019) show that drawdown statistics add explanatory power for performance differences that Sharpe or VaR miss.

* **Encourages Robust Portfolio Construction:** By penalizing large losses, drawdown-based risk management often promotes **diversification and hedging**. Portfolios built with drawdown constraints tend to avoid concentrated bets and may include protective assets (like options or treasuries) to reduce the magnitude of potential drawdowns. This can lead to more resilient portfolios in crisis periods. Even though the primary aim is to limit losses, an indirect benefit is avoiding overleveraged or highly correlated exposures that might go unnoticed under variance-based optimization.

## Limitations and Challenges of Drawdown Measures

Despite their appeal, drawdown-focused risk measures come with certain drawbacks and challenges, as the literature acknowledges:

* **Path Dependence and Complexity:** The very feature that makes drawdowns useful – path dependence – also makes them **harder to model and predict**. There is no simple closed-form distribution for maximum drawdown except under very specific assumptions. Estimating the risk of future drawdowns often requires heavy Monte Carlo simulation or complex mathematical tools. In contrast, VaR can often be computed (under assumptions) with straightforward formulas. This complexity means implementing drawdown risk in real-time risk systems is computationally more intensive.

* **Historical Bias:** A common practical use of drawdown is to look at *realized historical MDD*. This single worst case from the past may not generalize to the future. If the historical sample is short or unrepresentative, the observed MDD could drastically under- or over-estimate true tail risk. For example, in a long bull market, the maximum drawdown observed might be small, lulling one into a sense of safety – until an unprecedented crash occurs. To address this, probabilistic measures like CED or MDaR are preferred, but then they face the modeling issues above. In short, **drawdown measures are very sensitive to sample history**; they are non-ergodic in a sense (one huge crash in your sample sets the risk metric for a long time).

* **Not Always Coherent or Smooth:** Some drawdown measures (like simple MDD) are not coherent risk measures, and even when convex, they can be non-smooth or hard to optimize due to the max operator. This can complicate their use in optimization. For instance, including a hard drawdown constraint in a portfolio problem typically calls for advanced techniques or heuristic algorithms, whereas a variance or ES constraint yields to convex programming. Researchers have worked on smoothing these via CDaR, etc., but implementing those requires careful tuning (e.g. deciding the tail fraction \$q%\$ to use). There’s also the issue of **time inconsistency**: a strategy that is optimal to minimize drawdown over a fixed horizon might not remain optimal if evaluated at intermediate points (a common issue with path-dependent objectives).

* **Overemphasis on Worst Case:** Focusing too much on avoiding drawdowns can lead to **over-conservative portfolios**. As Adam et al. (2008) pointed out, performance measures that primarily stress the worst-case (like using only MDD) may overweight investments that have historically had smaller tails. These could be low-return, low-risk assets (e.g. certain bonds or cash-like instruments). Such a portfolio might never experience a big drawdown, but it may also fail to meet growth targets. There’s a trade-off between minimizing drawdown and achieving returns; finding the balance is subjective and client-dependent. Moreover, if every manager targets a very low drawdown, many will converge to similar “safe” strategies, potentially reducing diversification benefits across the industry and leading to crowded trades in presumed safe assets.

* **Neglect of Frequency of Losses:** Drawdown measures excel at capturing **depth**, but unless paired with something like Ulcer Index or drawdown duration, they might not fully capture the *frequency* of drawdowns. For example, two strategies each have a 20% MDD in a given period. One did it in one big crash, the other in four smaller 20% dips that recovered in between. Both have the same max drawdown, but arguably the latter was riskier (more frequent pain) or maybe less risky (since recoveries happened) depending on perspective. The MDD alone wouldn’t distinguish them. Additional metrics (like average drawdown or total time in drawdown) are needed to get a fuller picture. Challet’s (2017) work on drawdown duration addresses this, but such metrics are not yet standard.

* **Data and Horizon Dependence:** The magnitude of drawdown risk can depend on the time window considered. A 5-year track record might show a 15% max drawdown, but over 20 years that same strategy might have seen a 50% drawdown at some point. Unlike volatility (which tends to scale with the square root of time under certain assumptions), **drawdowns do not scale easily with horizon** – they tend to increase with longer observation windows as the chance of encountering a severe downturn rises. This means comparing drawdowns across funds or asset classes requires a consistent timeframe and careful interpretation. It also means that as new data comes in, the max drawdown can only stay the same or get worse (never “improving” unless one resets the measurement period). This ratchet-like behavior is awkward – a single new bad event can suddenly change your risk metric substantially.

* **Limited Regulatory Adoption (So Far):** While drawdown measures are popular in practice, they are not (yet) as embedded in regulatory frameworks as VaR or ES. Banks and insurers, for example, are required to compute capital based on VaR/ES-type measures, not maximum drawdown. There has been some discussion (and as noted, some regulators tracking hedge funds do consider drawdowns) but it’s not standardized. This means the literature on drawdowns has been somewhat more practitioner-driven and not as uniform as, say, the vast research on VaR. It’s a limitation in the sense that one cannot easily compare drawdown risk across institutions the way one can compare, for instance, their 99% 10-day VaR disclosures.

In summary, drawdown risk metrics, for all their appeal, require careful handling. They should be used with awareness of their dependence on historical scenarios and their potential to skew portfolio choices. The academic consensus is not that drawdowns replace traditional measures, but that they add a valuable dimension – one just has to manage their idiosyncrasies (non-linearity, horizon effects, etc.) in practical applications.

## Use Cases and Recent Developments

Drawdown measures have found a variety of applications in both portfolio management and risk oversight. Here we highlight some use cases, as well as recent research trends:

* **Hedge Fund Due Diligence:** Investors in hedge funds and alternative strategies often use maximum drawdown as a quick gauge of downside risk tolerance of a manager. It’s common to see an offering memorandum state the historical MDD, and prospective investors may have thresholds (e.g. avoiding funds that ever lost more than 30% peak-to-trough). The Calmar and Sterling ratios (return vs. drawdown) are frequently reported. These practice-driven uses are backed by studies that show why they matter: a fund that can maintain moderate drawdowns is less likely to face forced liquidation or investor runs. When evaluating two strategies with similar returns, the one with a gentler drawdown profile is often preferable, because it suggests better risk management or more consistent alpha.

* **Risk Management and Stop-Loss Rules:** At the trading strategy level, drawdown control is used to trigger intervention. For example, a trading algorithm might reduce exposure if drawdown exceeds a certain percent, or a fund might have a policy to de-risk once the fund is 10% off its high. These rules are essentially hard drawdown limits. There is academic work on **optimal stopping related to drawdowns** – e.g. figuring out the probability of hitting certain drawdown levels and timing of hitting them (so one can set prudent stop-loss limits). Such techniques have been explored in the context of *trading strategies, robo-advisors, and pension decumulation* to prevent ruin. Recent research (e.g. **Zheng et al. 2021**, not cited above, but in the spirit of ongoing work) uses machine learning to dynamically allocate assets aiming to minimize drawdown while achieving targets. The motivation is clear: by limiting drawdown, one preserves capital to stay in the game when the market eventually rebounds.

* **Tail Risk Hedging Products:** There’s been growth in financial products specifically designed to mitigate drawdowns. These include managed **tail-risk funds**, options-based overlays, and structured notes that pay off when a reference portfolio exceeds a certain drawdown. Academic researchers have examined the cost/benefit of these strategies. For instance, buying protective put options will cap drawdown but at the cost of option premiums; the optimal mix depends on an investor’s risk aversion to drawdown vs cost (this links to the concept of drawdown as a constraint in utility optimization). The literature on “portfolio insurance” from the 1980s (Black-Scholes, etc.) can be reinterpreted as drawdown control – ensuring the portfolio never falls below a floor (which is a drawdown of a certain size from the peak). Modern tail hedging research often evaluates success by reduction in drawdown during crises.

* **Multi-Asset and Strategy Comparisons:** Academic surveys (like **Geboers, Depaire & Annaert 2022**, published in J. Economic Surveys) have looked at drawdowns across asset classes over centuries. By compiling data from equities, bonds, gold, etc., they show that all assets have had significant drawdowns, but the frequency and recovery times differ. For example, bonds historically have smaller drawdowns but also lower returns, whereas equities have larger drawdowns but higher returns – implying a risk premium for enduring drawdowns. Such analyses reinforce that drawdown is a fundamental aspect of risk/return trade-off. Additionally, in the context of **retirement portfolios**, the notion of “safe withdrawal rates” is tied to sequences of returns: a major early drawdown can ruin a retirement plan even if average returns pan out. Therefore, some retirement research now explicitly considers drawdown probabilities to advise on asset allocations for retirees.

* **Recent Developments:** The COVID-19 shock of 2020, as mentioned, has been a case study for drawdown risk management. In just one month (Feb–Mar 2020), U.S. equities fell \~34%, a drawdown that triggered many volatility-targeting funds to deleverage and some risk-parity funds to hit loss limits. However, the subsequent rapid recovery was also unprecedented. This whipsaw exposed that an approach focusing solely on volatility (which spiked then mean-reverted) could be caught wrong-footed, whereas a drawdown-aware approach might have more systematically re-risked after the trough. The event spurred new research on **dynamic drawdown strategies** – how to cautiously resume risk-taking after a drawdown without catching a “falling knife.” There is also growing interest in **tail metrics for portfolios of hedge funds or private assets**, where valuation smoothing might hide drawdowns. Techniques akin to CED are being applied to estimate what the “true” economic drawdowns are for illiquid assets (e.g., inferring what a private equity fund’s drawdown would be if marked to market).

* **Behavioral Finance Integration:** Another recent angle is combining drawdown analysis with investor behavior models. For instance, studies on retail trading accounts find that individuals often liquidate positions after they’ve fallen a certain percentage (realizing losses due to fear of further drawdown). This has led to models of *endogenous drawdowns*, where the drawdown itself can cause feedback (as in stop-loss cascades). Academically, this is connecting drawdown metrics with concepts like **stop-loss induced volatility** and market microstructure during crashes.

Overall, the trajectory of recent research suggests that drawdown has shifted from being a niche concern to a mainstream risk metric, especially in the era of frequent tail events. Both academia and industry continue to refine how drawdowns can be forecast, mitigated, and used in decision-making. As one survey title aptly put it, drawdown is coming “*from practice to theory and back again*”, meaning it originated as a practical concern, is now studied theoretically, and is influencing practice anew with more sophisticated tools.

## Conclusion

Academic literature increasingly recognizes drawdowns as a critical tail risk measure that complements traditional risk metrics. Theoretical studies have formalized drawdown-based measures (like CDaR and CED) and shown how to integrate them into coherent risk frameworks and portfolio optimization. Empirical research across asset classes demonstrates that drawdown metrics often reveal hidden vulnerabilities that volatility or VaR overlook – for example, uncovering the crash risk in seemingly uncorrelated hedge fund strategies or highlighting the true pain of financial crises in terms of depth and recovery time. Drawdowns align closely with investor experience and behavior, focusing on the peaks and valleys that define financial journeys, not just the final outcome.

In comparing drawdowns to other risk measures, the literature emphasizes that **no single metric is sufficient**. Volatility and VaR are useful for day-to-day risk management and regulatory needs, but drawdown-based measures provide an essential lens on *worst-case path risk*. The advantages of drawdowns lie in their intuitive appeal and their attention to extreme losses and capital preservation. Their limitations – such as modeling complexity and potential over-conservatism – are active areas of research, with ongoing work to improve estimation techniques and combine drawdown control with return maximization in smarter ways.

Influential papers by Chekhlov et al. (2005), Goldberg & Mahmoud (2017), and others have laid the foundation, and recent studies (Geboers et al. 2022, Challet 2017, Kessler et al. 2019, among many) continue to expand our understanding of drawdowns in different contexts. With markets repeatedly reminding us of the reality of tail risks, drawdown measures are likely to remain at the forefront of risk management research and practice, helping investors navigate the ups **and (draw)downs** of financial markets.
